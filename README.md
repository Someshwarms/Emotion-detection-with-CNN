# Emotion-detection-with-CNN


# Link for the dataset is given here: https://www.kaggle.com/shawon10/ckplus

**First of all this project is based on Deep learning.In this project the model i used is the combination of 4 convolutional layer(Convo2D) with addition of 4 maxpooling layer(MaxPooling2D),1 Flatten layer,1 DropOut layer,and 2 Dense of fully connected layer.For optimizer i am using adam and in case of loss fuction i am using Categorical crossentropy and in all the layer except output layer i haved used relu activation fuction and in output layer i used softmax activation fuction.**

**And the Dataset which  i am using have seven different class of emotion with 1000 different images of pixel(0 to 255).**
